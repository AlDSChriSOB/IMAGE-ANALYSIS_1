# IMAGE-ANALYSIS_1
This script focuses on setting up an image dataset for use in a deep learning model, likely for image classification.

Library Imports

The code imports TensorFlow (tensorflow) and its submodules keras (high-level deep learning API) and layers (building blocks for neural networks).
NumPy (numpy) is imported for numerical operations.
Data Directory

The script defines the data directory path (data_dir) where the image dataset is stored. The specific path points to a directory named "mc-fakes-smaller" within the "AAI" folder on drive D.
Image Preprocessing Parameters

Several variables are defined to specify image preprocessing parameters:
batch_size: This determines the number of images processed together during training. Here, it's set to 32.
img_height and img_width: These define the target image size for resizing during preprocessing. Both are set to 160 pixels.
IMG_SIZE: This is a tuple combining img_height and img_width for convenience, representing the image dimensions as (160, 160).
Loading Training Dataset

The script utilizes tf.keras.preprocessing.image_dataset_from_directory to load the image dataset from the specified directory (data_dir).

Key arguments passed to the function:

data_dir: Path to the data directory.
validation_split: This splits the dataset into training and validation sets with a 20% validation split (80% for training).
subset="training": Specifies to use only the training subset of the data.
seed=123: Sets a random seed for splitting the data, ensuring reproducibility.
image_size=(img_height, img_width): Resizes images to the specified dimensions (160x160).
batch_size=batch_size: Defines the batch size for training (32 images per batch).
Note: The script defines steps for loading the training dataset but doesn't show the equivalent step for the validation set. You might encounter a corresponding code block later that loads the validation set using a similar approach.

This script demonstrates using a high-level TensorFlow function for efficient image dataset loading and preprocessing. It sets the stage for building and training a deep learning model on the prepared image data.
